# AWS-Reactjs
I have already deleted the resources within the app.
AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS Amplify, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Cognito

1) AWS Amplify allows me to host static resources for my web applications with continous deployment.
2) AWS Cognito allows me to manage users' accounts.
3) AWS Lambda allows me to handle requests
4) AWS API Gateway allows me to expose the Lambda function thats linked to the Restful API.
